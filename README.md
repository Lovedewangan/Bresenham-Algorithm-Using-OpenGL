# Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm Visualization
Overview
This C++ OpenGL application demonstrates the implementation of Bresenham's line drawing algorithm, providing an interactive graphical interface for drawing and analyzing lines on a 2D coordinate grid.
Features

Interactive line drawing using mouse clicks
Real-time slope calculation
Grid-based coordinate system
Bresenham's algorithm implementation for precise line rendering
Clear screen functionality with right-click

How to Use

Left-click to place points and draw lines
Right-click to clear the screen
Coordinates and slope are displayed on the screen
Works with a 200x200 coordinate grid

Technical Details

Developed using OpenGL and FreeGLUT
